## Detective skills

How many times have you written some Python code, only to discover it doesn't work properly and you're not sure why? It would be really helpful to have some new detective skills in your toolbox to help you test your code and find bugs more easily!

The following techniques are really useful for testing programs:

- Asserting a condition is true, and raising an error if it is not
- Logging the state of your program as it progresses
- Stepping through a program

You can do all of these things without having to install any special software, you just need Python 3 and the IDLE editor. And you will be able to use the same techniques to test programs in other languages as well.
