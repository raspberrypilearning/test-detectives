## Detective skills

How many times have you written some Python code and discovered that it doesn't work properly? It would be really helpful to have some new detective skills in your toolbox to help you test your code and find bugs more easily.

The following techniques are really useful for testing programs:

- Asserting a condition is true, and raising an error if it is not
- Logging the state of your program as it progresses
- Stepping through a program

You can do all of these without having to install any special software, you just need Python 3 and the IDLE editor.
