## To log or not to log

Logging is useful because you can change the level of detail for messages you wish to see. Here are the possible levels, going from most detail to least:

| Level    | Meaning |
| -------- | -------- |
| DEBUG	   | Detailed information used to debug your program. |
| INFO	   | Confirmation that things are working as expected. |
| WARNING  | Something unexpected happened, but the program is still running. |
| ERROR	   | The program has not been able to perform a particular function. |
| CRITICAL | A serious error. The program may stop running. |
